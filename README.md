# UUV DEV 2018-2019

 
Under each folder are the different tasks that we need for the Sub to function the way we want to

*Past_Documents* holds:

  A quick start guide on how to start the motors on the sub in case one would want to get started
  
  Documents that last years team made

## Where to go ##

There is a gitbook detailing essentially everything 

[NGCP-UUV Guide](https://ngcp-uuv.gitbook.io/ngcp-uuv-guide)

There is also a google drive holding all of the files
You need access from the owner of this google drive

Any files that I can put publicly I will put on this github, if not it will be on the google drive
